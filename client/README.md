# Bad Banking App 

## Description of the project:
 This is a banking app without security measures. It's solely a project aimed at practicing my first Reacts app creations through the toolchain CREATE REACT APP. The app enables users to create an account with minimal requirements and perform basic transactions such as depositing to their balance and withdrawing. However, these transactions are not connected to any specific user, serving merely as an example. I intend to continue working on this project to improve it and move towards developing a more realistic and secure banking application.

## How to Run:
This project was initiated using the Create React App tool, and connects with the browser as follows: **Note: this app alsso uses libraries such as bootstrap react, react-dom, formik. Make sure to run this instalation in your terminal, got to section extra installations**


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Extra Installations
#### react-dom
This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It is intended to be paired with the generic React package, which is shipped as react to npm.

##### Installation
npm install react react-dom [More INFO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

#### react-bootstrap
##### Installation
The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which you can install with npm (or yarn if you prefer).

If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to install vanilla Bootstrap as well.

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap [More INFO](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction)

#### formik
##### Installation
You can install Formik with NPM, Yarn, or a good ol' <script> via unpkg.com.

NPM
Copy
 npm install formik --save
or

Copy
 yarn add formik

## Roadmap of future improvements:
There are numerous improvements and additions that can be implemented in this code. For example:

- The banking app lacks security measures and is primarily a practice project for React app development.
- Users can create accounts with minimal requirements and perform basic transactions, but transactions are not linked to specific users.
- The intention is to improve the app by implementing measures such as user authentication and transaction encryption.
- Additionally, the application architecture will be enhanced for scalability and maintainability.
 Regular updates and security patching will be prioritized to maintain the app's reliability and protect user data.
